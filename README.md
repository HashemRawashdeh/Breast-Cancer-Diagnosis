# Breast Cancer Diagnosis
Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in the successful treatment of breast cancer. However, accurately diagnosing breast cancer in its early stages remains a challenge. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging logistic regression and analyzing extensive patient data to develop a predictive model for accurate breast cancer detection. The utilization of this model will aid in early detection, enabling timely medical interventions and ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
